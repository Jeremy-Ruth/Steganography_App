# Stegonography_App Ver 1.0

Stegonography is the practice of concealing secret information within data or information that is not secret. This method can offer some interesting alternatives to the more common modern day use of cryptography in that, rather than seeking to protect information that is intended to remaing secret, stegonography seeks to conceal the existence of sensitive information altogether. Enhancing stegonagraphy with cryptography offers an even more secure method of passing secret information. This application offers a means to apply stgenography to images using the common LSB (least significant bit) method. Additionally, it offers an optional layer of protection through the use of "key images" that can be applied to mask the underlying secret information even if its existence is suspected. A more detailed description about the process used can be found in the "docs" folder.
